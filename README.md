# pegasus-steam-wrapper
A quick and dirty Steam wrapper for Pegasus Frontend to ensure Steam closes once the game is closed.

## Notes
This currently only works with the FlatPak version of Pegasus and the local version of Steam.

## Installation
Run the following commands:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amura11/pegasus-steam-wrapper/main/steam-wrapper.sh
sudo mv steam-wrapper.sh /usr/local/bin/steam
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/steam
```

Run Steam games from Pegasus!
